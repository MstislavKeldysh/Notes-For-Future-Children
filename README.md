# Notes-For-Future-Children
Hi!

This Repository is meant mostly for mathematical proofs and derivations. 
Some sections should be used to "complement your courses".
There currently are no practice questions but those might be coming at some point? 

There are currently two versions of this Google Drive:
YRDSB VERSION: tinyurl.com/NotesForFutureChildrenYRDSB
Personal Account Version:  tinyurl.com/NFFCP

Starting Summer of 2021, only the Personal Account Version will be maintained (because I will graduate).

If you have any questions on the content (you don't understand something or you found a typo),
use this link to join our Slack: tinyurl.com/NFFCSlack

Here, I will try my best to answer any questions, math help etc. 

The Slack server is also used to proofread my content before any of it gets posted on Notes for Future Children. 

That is also the best place to contact me directly.


Ivan Ovchinnikov, Bayview 2021 graduate.
