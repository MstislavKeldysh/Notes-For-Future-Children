# Notes-For-Future-Children
Hi!

This Repository is initially meant mostly for mathematical proofs and derivations. It has since grown to include notes and projects I write for all subjects. Note that this includes material at the high school and undergraduate level. 
Some sections (like the Geometry subfolder in Math) are meant to be self contained guides, while others offer overviews of concrete concepts.
<!--#Some sections can be used to "complement your courses".-->
There are some problems I have compiled. They are usually meant to be setp by step ``walk throughs" of some interesting idea. 

<!--There are currently two versions of this Google Drive:-->
<!--#YRDSB VERSION: tinyurl.com/NotesForFutureChildrenYRDSB-->
<!--#Personal Account Version:  tinyurl.com/NFFCP-->

<!--#Starting Summer of 2021, only the Personal Account Version will be maintained (because I will graduate).-->

If you have any questions on the content (you don't understand something or you found a typo),
use this link to join our Slack: tinyurl.com/NFFCSlack

Here, I will try my best to answer any questions, math help etc. 

The Slack server is also used to proofread my content before any of it gets posted on Notes for Future Children. 

That is also the best place to contact me directly.
